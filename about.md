## Now

I'm currently a lead iOS developer at [Rosetta Stone](http://product.rosettastone.com), where I've been working since January 2011.

## Previously

I worked for about 10 years using C#, SQL, Visual Basic, Java, Objective C, and C.  Before that, I was a chemist and a lab technician, where one day while writing a data acquisition program, I thought, *this is really fun*.  So, I set aside my Chemical Physics BS and went back to school at night to make sure I knew what I was doing. 

I wrote my first iOS app in 2009 as a new front end to a Windows service I had written, then published a small utility on the app store in 2010.  At Rosetta Stone, I've helped deliver several apps.

## Where

Built in Detroit, I live in beautiful Colorado.

## What I Mean

I am passionate about design and development, and strive to constantly learn and improve.

## What Else

I have a wonderful family ♥︎  

Aside from my love of programming, I have a lifelong love of writing and reading, music, and the Detroit Tigers.
