In writing a full stack To Do app for my own education, an Edutudu, I am going to start with a Vapor web service.  This of course raises two questions: why start with a web service, and why Vapor?

The most well known Swift web frameworks right now are [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) and [Kitura](https://www.kitura.io).  There are [good](https://www.raywenderlich.com/1323930-vapor-vs-kitura-choosing-a-server-side-swift-framework) [comparisons](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/73/server-side-swift-kitura-vs-vapor) around, and plenty of tutorials on each. Either is a good option.  What sold me on Vapor is mostly [Fluent](https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/fluent/getting-started/), Vapor's ORM framework. Vapor also has a [command line tool](https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/getting-started/toolbox/) that allows quick creation of an Xcode project to house the Vapor application.

This is the second reason I am starting with Vapor, though it is minor. Rather than create projects and integrate them later, I'm starting with the project generated by the toolbox, and will base a workspace off of it.  There's not a hugely compelling reason to do this, but I do need a place to start and this one option.

I'm going to be following the [Vapor docs](https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/getting-started/hello-world/).

The first step is installing the Vapor Toolbox via Homebrew.

{% highlight sh %}
brew tap vapor/tap
brew install vapor/tap/vapor
{% endhighlight %}

Next we'll create a new site:

```sh
vapor new EduTuDuWeb
```

And an Xcode project:

```sh
cd EduTuDuWeb
vapor xcode
```

Open the project, select the `Run` schema on `My Mac`, open http://localhost:8080/hello and there we are! 

Hello, world!

Now, this isn't all that much of an accomplishment.  Following a recipe, using a tool, and having a template generate a project.  But it's a good start, and a base to begin with.  Next time, we'll start customizing.

I'm not yet sure it's accurate, but I think of Vapor like a younger kind of Rails or Django, a framework and scaffolding for creating web applications quickly. I'm familiar with Ruby on Rails, so I'm hoping this is an easy leap to make. 

Vapor has already given me a `routes.swift` with some routes defined, a model, and a controller. The funny thing is that the default model is called `Todo`.  Either this means "to-do" as in, here's a placeholder for your model, or To Do apps are a common Hello World. Maybe both.  Maybe they knew I was on my way over.

I don't yet have a database set up, and one point of my exercise is to pull common data structures together.  So I'll be adapting the Todo class in Part II.
